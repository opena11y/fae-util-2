# fae-util-2
Utility used by FAE technologies to spider and analyze web pages using OpenAjax evaluation library using the chrome browser

## Overview 

* The utility is designed to support spidering a website or traversing a list of URLs and analyzing the content of each URL using JavaScript. 
* Utility accepts a configuration file identifying URLs for analysis and a list of JavaScript files to be used for analysis. 
* Using these inputs, it retrieves the DOM specified by the URL information, runs the code in the JavaScript files using the DOM as an input, and returns the output of the JavaScript. 
* The JavaScript files used for analysis must return text content (e.g. in some format like JSON or XML) for each URL and this content is saved to disk.
* The utility also provides additional information URL, such as the request and returned URL, and URLS that were filtered or could not be processed for some reason (i.e. broken link, invalid script)
